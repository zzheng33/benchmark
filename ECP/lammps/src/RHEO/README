RHEO or Reproducing Hydrodynamics and Elastic Objects is a package to model
multiphase fluid systems. The authors include Joel Clemmer (Sandia), Thomas
O'Connor (Carnegie Mellon), and Eric Palermo (Carnegie Mellon).

Bond style rheo/shell, compute style rheo/property/atom, and fix style
rheo/temperature depend on the BPM package, so it is required to install
the BPM package with RHEO.

This package requires the BLAS/LAPACK.  This can be either a seperate installation
or you can use the bundled "linalg" library.  Please see the LAMMPS manual at
https://docs.lammps.org/Build_extras.html#rheo for details.
