Each directory shows how to use LAMMPS in tandem with a specific
quantum code:

LATTE = semi-empirical tight-binding code from LANL
  https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1526907-los-alamos-transferable-tight-binding-energetics-latte-version
  https://github.com/lanl/LATTE

NWChem = computational chemistry code from PNNL
  focus here is on DFT portion of NWChem = PWDFT library
  https://www.nwchem-sw.org

PySCF = quantum chemistry code from Caltech
  https://pyscf.org/index.html

-----------------------------------------------------

To be added later (as of March 2023):

Quantum Espresso (QE) = DFT code for materials modeling
  https://www.quantum-espresso.org

DFT-FE = real-space DFT code from U Michigan
  https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe

INQ = DFT code from LLNL
  https://github.com/LLNL/inq
