Description
"""""""""""

.. versionchanged:: 28Mar2023

Fix pimd was renamed to fix *pimd/nvt* and fix *pimd/langevin* was added.

These fix commands perform quantum molecular dynamics simulations based
on the Feynman path-integral to include effects of tunneling and
zero-point motion.  In this formalism, the isomorphism of a quantum
partition function for the original system to a classical partition
function for a ring-polymer system is exploited, to efficiently sample
configurations from the canonical ensemble :ref:`(Feynman) <Feynman>`.

The classical partition function and its components are given
by the following equations:

.. math::

   Z = & \int d{\bf q} d{\bf p} \cdot \textrm{exp} [ -\beta H_{eff} ] \\
   H_{eff} = & \bigg(\sum_{i=1}^P \frac{p_i^2}{2M_i}\bigg) + V_{eff} \\
   V_{eff} = & \sum_{i=1}^P \bigg[ \frac{mP}{2\beta^2 \hbar^2} (q_i - q_{i+1})^2 + \frac{1}{P} V(q_i)\bigg]

:math:`M_i` is the fictitious mass of the :math:`i`-th mode, and m is the actual mass of the atoms.

The interested user is referred to any of the numerous references on
this methodology, but briefly, each quantum particle in a path integral
simulation is represented by a ring-polymer of P quasi-beads, labeled
from 1 to P.  During the simulation, each quasi-bead interacts with
beads on the other ring-polymers with the same imaginary time index (the
second term in the effective potential above).  The quasi-beads also
interact with the two neighboring quasi-beads through the spring
potential in imaginary-time space (first term in effective potential).
To sample the canonical ensemble, any thermostat can be applied.

Fix *pimd/nvt* applies a Nose-Hoover massive chain thermostat
:ref:`(Tuckerman) <pimd-Tuckerman>`.  With the massive chain
algorithm, a chain of NH thermostats is coupled to each degree of
freedom for each quasi-bead.  The keyword *temp* sets the target
temperature for the system and the keyword *nhc* sets the number *Nc* of
thermostats in each chain.  For example, for a simulation of N particles
with P beads in each ring-polymer, the total number of NH thermostats
would be 3 x N x P x Nc.

Fix *pimd/langevin* implements a Langevin thermostat in the normal mode
representation, and also provides a barostat to sample the NPH/NPT ensembles.

.. note::

   Both these *fix* styles implement a complete velocity-verlet integrator
   combined with a thermostat, so no other time integration fix should be used.

The *method* keyword determines what style of PIMD is performed.  A
value of *pimd* is standard PIMD.  A value of *nmpimd* is for
normal-mode PIMD.  A value of *cmd* is for centroid molecular dynamics
(CMD).  The difference between the styles is as follows.

   In standard PIMD, the value used for a bead's fictitious mass is
   arbitrary.  A common choice is to use :math:`M_i = m/P`, which results in the
   mass of the entire ring-polymer being equal to the real quantum
   particle.  But it can be difficult to efficiently integrate the
   equations of motion for the stiff harmonic interactions in the ring
   polymers.

   A useful way to resolve this issue is to integrate the equations of
   motion in a normal mode representation, using Normal Mode
   Path-Integral Molecular Dynamics (NMPIMD) :ref:`(Cao1) <Cao1>`.  In
   NMPIMD, the NH chains are attached to each normal mode of the
   ring-polymer and the fictitious mass of each mode is chosen as Mk =
   the eigenvalue of the Kth normal mode for k > 0. The k = 0 mode,
   referred to as the zero-frequency mode or centroid, corresponds to
   overall translation of the ring-polymer and is assigned the mass of
   the real particle.

.. note::

   Motion of the centroid can be effectively uncoupled from the other
   normal modes by scaling the fictitious masses to achieve a partial
   adiabatic separation.  This is called a Centroid Molecular Dynamics
   (CMD) approximation :ref:`(Cao2) <Cao2>`.  The time-evolution (and
   resulting dynamics) of the quantum particles can be used to obtain
   centroid time correlation functions, which can be further used to
   obtain the true quantum correlation function for the original system.
   The CMD method also uses normal modes to evolve the system, except
   only the k > 0 modes are thermostatted, not the centroid degrees of
   freedom.

.. versionadded:: 21Nov2023

   Mode *pimd* added to fix pimd/langevin.

Fix pimd/langevin supports the *method* values *nmpimd* and *pimd*. The default value is *nmpimd*.
If *method* is *nmpimd*, the normal mode representation is used to integrate the equations of motion.
The exact solution of harmonic oscillator is used to propagate the free ring polymer part of the Hamiltonian.
If *method* is *pimd*, the Cartesian representation is used to integrate the equations of motion.
The harmonic force is added to the total force of the system, and the numerical integrator is used to propagate the Hamiltonian.

The keyword *integrator* specifies the Trotter splitting method used by *fix pimd/langevin*.
See :ref:`(Liu) <Liu>` for a discussion on the OBABO and BAOAB splitting schemes. Typically
either of the two should work fine.

The keyword *fmass* sets a further scaling factor for the fictitious
masses of beads, which can be used for the Partial Adiabatic CMD
:ref:`(Hone) <Hone>`, or to be set as P, which results in the fictitious
masses to be equal to the real particle masses.

The keyword *fmmode* of *fix pimd/langevin* determines the mode of fictitious
mass preconditioning. There are two options: *physical* and *normal*. If *fmmode* is
*physical*, then the physical mass of the particles are used (and then multiplied by
*fmass*). If *fmmode* is *normal*, then the physical mass is first multiplied by the
eigenvalue of each normal mode, and then multiplied by *fmass*. More precisely, the
fictitious mass of *fix pimd/langevin* is determined by two factors: *fmmode* and *fmass*.
If *fmmode* is *physical*, then the fictitious mass is

.. math::

   M_i = \mathrm{fmass} \times m

If *fmmode* is *normal*, then the fictitious mass is

.. math::

   M_i = \mathrm{fmass} \times \lambda_i \times m

where :math:`\lambda_i` is the eigenvalue of the :math:`i`-th normal mode.

.. note::

   Fictitious mass is only used in the momentum of the equation of motion
   (:math:`\mathbf{p}_i=M_i\mathbf{v}_i`), and not used in the spring elastic energy
   (:math:`\sum_{i=1}^P \frac{1}{2}m\omega_P^2(q_i - q_{i+1})^2`, :math:`m` is always the
   actual mass of the particles).

The keyword *sp* is a scaling factor on Planck's constant, which can
be useful for debugging or other purposes.  The default value of 1.0
is appropriate for most situations.

The keyword *ensemble* for fix style *pimd/langevin* determines which ensemble is it
going to sample. The value can be *nve* (microcanonical), *nvt* (canonical), *nph* (isoenthalpic),
and *npt* (isothermal-isobaric).

The keyword *temp* specifies temperature parameter for fix styles *pimd/nvt* and *pimd/langevin*. It should read
a positive floating-point number.

.. note::

   For pimd simulations, a temperature values should be specified even for nve ensemble. Temperature will make a difference
   for nve pimd, since the spring elastic frequency between the beads will be affected by the temperature.

The keyword *thermostat* reads *style* and *seed* of thermostat for fix style *pimd/langevin*. *style* can only
be *PILE_L* (path integral Langevin equation local thermostat, as described in :ref:`Ceriotti <Ceriotti2>`), and *seed* should a positive integer number, which serves as the seed of the pseudo random number generator.

.. note::

   The fix style *pimd/langevin* uses the stochastic PILE_L thermostat to control temperature. This thermostat works on the normal modes
   of the ring polymer. The *tau* parameter controls the centroid mode, and the *scale* parameter controls the non-centroid modes.

The keyword *tau* specifies the thermostat damping time parameter for fix style *pimd/langevin*. It is in time unit. It only works on the centroid mode.

The keyword *scale* specifies a scaling parameter for the damping times of the non-centroid modes for fix style *pimd/langevin*. The default
damping time of the non-centroid mode :math:`i` is :math:`\frac{P}{\beta\hbar}\sqrt{\lambda_i\times\mathrm{fmass}}` (*fmmode* is *physical*) or  :math:`\frac{P}{\beta\hbar}\sqrt{\mathrm{fmass}}` (*fmmode* is *normal*). The damping times of all non-centroid modes are the default values divided by *scale*.

The barostat parameters for fix style *pimd/langevin* with *npt* or *nph* ensemble is specified using one of *iso* and *aniso*
keywords. A *pressure* value should be given with pressure unit. The keyword *iso* means couple all 3 diagonal components together when pressure is computed (hydrostatic pressure), and dilate/contract the dimensions together. The keyword *aniso* means x, y, and z dimensions are controlled independently using the Pxx, Pyy, and Pzz components of the stress tensor as the driving forces, and the specified scalar external pressure.

The keyword *barostat* reads *style* of barostat for fix style *pimd/langevin*. *style* can
be *BZP* (Bussi-Zykova-Parrinello, as described in :ref:`Bussi <Bussi>`) or *MTTK* (Martyna-Tuckerman-Tobias-Klein, as described in :ref:`Martyna1 <Martyna3>` and :ref:`Martyna2 <Martyna4>`).

The keyword *taup* specifies the barostat damping time parameter for fix style *pimd/langevin*. It is in time unit.

The keyword *fixcom* specifies whether the center-of-mass of the extended ring-polymer system is fixed during the pimd simulation.
Once *fixcom* is set to be *yes*, the center-of-mass velocity will be distracted from the centroid-mode velocities in each step.

The keyword *lj* should be used if :doc:`lj units <units>` is used for *fix pimd/langevin*. Typically one may want to use
reduced units to run the simulation, and then convert the results into some physical units (for example, :doc:`metal units <units>`). In this case, the 5 quantities in the physical mass units are needed: epsilon (energy scale), sigma (length scale), mass, Planck's constant, mvv2e (mass * velocity^2 to energy conversion factor). Planck's constant and mvv2e can be found in src/update.cpp. If there is no need to convert reduced units to physical units, you can omit the keyword *lj* and these five values will be set to 1.

The PIMD algorithm in LAMMPS is implemented as a hyper-parallel scheme
as described in :ref:`Calhoun <Calhoun>`.  In LAMMPS this is done by using
:doc:`multi-replica feature <Howto_replica>` in LAMMPS, where each
quasi-particle system is stored and simulated on a separate partition
of processors.  The following diagram illustrates this approach.  The
original system with 2 ring polymers is shown in red.  Since each ring
has 4 quasi-beads (imaginary time slices), there are 4 replicas of the
system, each running on one of the 4 partitions of processors.  Each
replica (shown in green) owns one quasi-bead in each ring.

.. image:: JPG/pimd.jpg
   :align: center

To run a PIMD simulation with M quasi-beads in each ring polymer using
N MPI tasks for each partition's domain-decomposition, you would use P
= MxN processors (cores) and run the simulation as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   mpirun -np P lmp_mpi -partition MxN -in script

Note that in the LAMMPS input script for a multi-partition simulation,
it is often very useful to define a :doc:`uloop-style variable <variable>` such as

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   variable ibead uloop M pad

where M is the number of quasi-beads (partitions) used in the
calculation.  The uloop variable can then be used to manage I/O
related tasks for each of the partitions, e.g.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   dump dcd all dcd 10 system_${ibead}.dcd
   dump 1 all custom 100 ${ibead}.xyz id type x y z vx vy vz ix iy iz fx fy fz
   restart 1000 system_${ibead}.restart1 system_${ibead}.restart2
   read_restart system_${ibead}.restart2

.. note::

   Fix *pimd/langevin* dumps the Cartesian coordinates, but dumps the velocities and
   forces in the normal mode representation. If the Cartesian velocities and forces are
   needed, it is easy to perform the transformation when doing post-processing.

   It is recommended to dump the image flags (*ix iy iz*) for fix *pimd/langevin*. It
   will be useful if you want to calculate some estimators during post-processing.

Major differences of *fix pimd/nvt* and *fix pimd/langevin* are:

   #. *Fix pimd/nvt* includes Cartesian pimd, normal mode pimd, and centroid md. *Fix pimd/langevin* only intends to support normal mode pimd, as it is commonly enough for thermodynamic sampling.
   #. *Fix pimd/nvt* uses Nose-Hoover chain thermostat. *Fix pimd/langevin* uses Langevin thermostat.
   #. *Fix pimd/langevin* provides barostat, so the npt ensemble can be sampled. *Fix pimd/nvt* only support nvt ensemble.
   #. *Fix pimd/langevin* provides several quantum estimators in output.
   #. *Fix pimd/langevin* allows multiple processes for each bead. For *fix pimd/nvt*, there is a large chance that multi-process tasks for each bead may fail.
   #. The dump of *fix pimd/nvt* are all Cartesian. *Fix pimd/langevin* dumps normal-mode velocities and forces, and Cartesian coordinates.

Initially, the inter-replica communication and normal mode transformation parts of *fix pimd/langevin* are written based on
those of *fix pimd/nvt*, but are significantly revised.

Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fix *pimd/nvt* writes the state of the Nose/Hoover thermostat over all
quasi-beads to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  See the
:doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` command for info on how to re-specify
a fix in an input script that reads a restart file, so that the
operation of the fix continues in an uninterrupted fashion.

Fix *pimd/langevin* writes the state of the barostat overall beads to
:doc:`binary restart files <restart>`. Since it uses a stochastic thermostat,
the state of the thermostat is not written. However, the state of the system
can be restored by reading the restart file, except that it will re-initialize
the random number generator.

None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to fix pimd/nvt.

Fix *pimd/nvt* computes a global 3-vector, which can be accessed by
various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.  The three quantities in
the global vector are:

   #. the total spring energy of the quasi-beads,
   #. the current temperature of the classical system of ring polymers,
   #. the current value of the scalar virial estimator for the kinetic
      energy of the quantum system :ref:`(Herman) <Herman>`.

The vector values calculated by fix *pimd/nvt* are "extensive", except for the
temperature, which is "intensive".

Fix *pimd/langevin* computes a global vector of quantities, which
can be accessed by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`. Note that
it outputs multiple log files, and different log files contain information
about different beads or modes (see detailed explanations below). If *ensemble*
is *nve* or *nvt*, the vector has 10 values:

   #. kinetic energy of the normal mode
   #. spring elastic energy of the normal mode
   #. potential energy of the bead
   #. total energy of all beads (conserved if *ensemble* is *nve*)
   #. primitive kinetic energy estimator
   #. virial energy estimator
   #. centroid-virial energy estimator
   #. primitive pressure estimator
   #. thermodynamic pressure estimator
   #. centroid-virial pressure estimator

The first 3 are different for different log files, and the others are the same for different log files.

If *ensemble* is *nph* or *npt*, the vector stores internal variables of the barostat. If *iso* is used,
the vector has 15 values:

   #. kinetic energy of the normal mode
   #. spring elastic energy of the normal mode
   #. potential energy of the bead
   #. total energy of all beads (conserved if *ensemble* is *nve*)
   #. primitive kinetic energy estimator
   #. virial energy estimator
   #. centroid-virial energy estimator
   #. primitive pressure estimator
   #. thermodynamic pressure estimator
   #. centroid-virial pressure estimator
   #. barostat velocity
   #. barostat kinetic energy
   #. barostat potential energy
   #. barostat cell Jacobian
   #. enthalpy of the extended system (sum of 4, 12, 13, and 14; conserved if *ensemble* is *nph*)

If *aniso* or *x* or *y* or *z* is used for the barostat, the vector has 17 values:

   #. kinetic energy of the normal mode
   #. spring elastic energy of the normal mode
   #. potential energy of the bead
   #. total energy of all beads (conserved if *ensemble* is *nve*)
   #. primitive kinetic energy estimator
   #. virial energy estimator
   #. centroid-virial energy estimator
   #. primitive pressure estimator
   #. thermodynamic pressure estimator
   #. centroid-virial pressure estimator
   #. x component of barostat velocity
   #. y component of barostat velocity
   #. z component of barostat velocity
   #. barostat kinetic energy
   #. barostat potential energy
   #. barostat cell Jacobian
   #. enthalpy of the extended system (sum of 4, 14, 15, and 16; conserved if *ensemble* is *nph*)

No parameter of fix *pimd/nvt* or *pimd/langevin* can be used with the *start/stop* keywords
of the :doc:`run <run>` command.  Fix *pimd/nvt* or *pimd/langevin* is not invoked during
:doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

These fixes are part of the REPLICA package.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info.

Fix *pimd/nvt* cannot be used with :doc:`lj units <units>`.
Fix *pimd/langevin* can be used with :doc:`lj units <units>`. See the above part for how to use it.

A PIMD simulation can be initialized with a single data file read via
the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command.  However, this means all
quasi-beads in a ring polymer will have identical positions and
velocities, resulting in identical trajectories for all quasi-beads.  To
avoid this, users can simply initialize velocities with different random
number seeds assigned to each partition, as defined by the uloop
variable, e.g.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   velocity all create 300.0 1234${ibead} rot yes dist gaussian
