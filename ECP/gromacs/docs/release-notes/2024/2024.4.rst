This version was released on TODO, 2024. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in |Gromacs| since the
previous 2024.3 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2023.6 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Fix missing non-bonded interactions close to cut-off with GPUs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The GPU rolling pruning employed with the dual pair list setup used
an incorrect list part calculation. This caused a few parlist entries
not to be updated after the initial pruning, leading to a small number
of missing pair interactions. Unless the pair list lifetime ``nstlist``
was very large, these interactions were close to the cut-off and therefore
the errors were small.

Affected simulations: all GPU accelerated runs using GROMACS versions
starting with the 2018 release with dual pair list enabled.
This is enabled automatically with default Verlet buffering, but
it is disabled if the Verlet buffer is manually set
(or if the ``GMX_DISABLE_DYNAMICPRUNING`` environment variable is set).

Impact: Our analysis shows that the error caused by the missing interactions
does not have a measurable effect on either forces or energy conservation
in most atomistic simulations with default simulation settings.
While a manually increased ``nstlist``, hence increased (outer) pair list lifetime,
leads to an increase in the number of missing interactions, for useful value of
``nstlist`` the effect is still negligible.
There can be measurable effects in systems with vacuum, gas, or with
excessively large ``nstlist`` values. In our testing we could not detect artifacts
apart from systems crashing, so the chance of undetected incorrect results is small.

Fix illegal memory access with more VCM than T-coupling groups
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When there were more center of mass motion removal groups than
temperature coupling groups, mdrun could crash due to illegal
memory access. This bug did not affect the simulation results.

:issue:`5167`

Fix crashes when some atoms are not part of a VCM group
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Uninitialized memory was read when some atoms were not part of
a center of mass motion removal group. Often this memory contained
zero and everything would work as it should. But when this memory
was not zero, the simulation would crash within a few steps.

:issue:`5181`

Fix parameter handling for coarse-grained bonded potentials
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Free-energy perturbation has never been supported for restraint angle,
restraint dihedral, and combined bending-torsion potentials sometimes
used in coarse-grained force fields. This led to the hypothetical
B-state parameters being incorrectly handled in ``gmx grompp`` and
then incorrectly serialized to/from the .tpr file.

This was generally benign, even when such functional forms were in
use. However, when other interactions were perturbed, the incorrect
parameter handling made it look like the interactions with wrongly
implemented parameters were intended to be perturbed.  This condition
was sometimes achieved when using alchemical-embedding
system-preparation workflows.

Now the hypothetical B-state parameters are handled correctly, so
FEP-based workflows can succeed. Perturbation of the above-mentioned
interaction types is still not supported, however.

:issue:`5144`
:issue:`5147`

Fix Colvars output files always written to the working directory.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Colvars output files are now written in the same folder as edr file.

:issue:`5122`

Forbid the usage of triangle constraints with -update gpu
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Prevent using update on GPU if there are triangle constraints.

:issue:`5123`

``gmx_mpi mdrun`` could hang when using GPUs and separate PME ranks 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A logic error in task assignment for ``-nb gpu -pme cpu`` and separate PME ranks
made the (default) ``-ddorder interleave`` hang. Now it works.

:issue:`4345`

Dynamic load balancing was ineffective when special forces were present
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The timing for DLB included the calculation of special forces, e.g. pull code
and rotation. As these require communication, imbalance might not have been
measured. Now special forces are excluded from the timings.

:issue:`5188`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

grompp checked incorrect B-state charges with free-energy decoupling
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When the `couple-moltype` options was used, `gmx grompp` would check the
A-state charges instead of the B-state charges. This would lead to incorrect
or no warnings when B-state of the system had non-zero net charge.

:issue:`5200`

Fix dump crash with Colvars values
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fix `gmx dump` crash when trying to output the binary Colvars state file.

:issue:`5034`

Fix element and atom number deduction in during preprocessing
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Two-letter atom names like BR or CL were not correctly handled in the preprocessing
during  `gmx editconf`, `gmx pdb2gmx` and `gmx grompp`, leading to incorrect element
and  atom number assignment. This could lead to incorrect element names in output files
and possibly incorrect behaviour in QMMM simulations.

:issue:`5182`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix physical validation with Pymbar version 4
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Pymbar version 4 has a different API compared to version 3. Now we support
using either of those versions and internally handle the API differences.

:issue:`5130` 

Fix compatibility with VkFFT 1.3.5
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fix crash on |Gromacs| shutdown when external VkFFT 1.3.5
is used.

:issue:`5184`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Work around FetchContent warnings in CMake 3.30 and newer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CMake 3.30 began to complain about |Gromacs| use of FetchContent, so
now we tell such new versions to use the old policy.

:issue:`5140`

Fix various crashes when GMX_USE_COLVARS=NONE
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Colvars MDModule did not defined the Colvars custom mdp variables
when the Colvars library was not compiled, preventing tools
read correctly a tpr file generated with a GROMACS-Colvars version.
Prevent also the creation of a tpr file if Colvars module is activated
whereas GROMACS was not compiled with Colvars.
Proper exit if a Colvars simulation is launched whereas GROMACS was not
compiled with Colvars.

:issue:`5055`

Fix reading cgroups in some kubernetes containers
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Modern versions of kubernetes/docker do not appear to mount /etc/mtab in
the containers, and if we did not find cgroups we would not detect CPU
limits set through cgroups. Fixed by reading /proc/mounts instead.
This will only influence performance when running in (some) containers.
