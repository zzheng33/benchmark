**Summary**

(What do we need to set/change a policy for?)

**Impact**

(Policies do not replace doing work, every policy means one more thing people need to read, and we cannot have policies for every single question. Is this something that is absolutely required to have a policy for that warrants the entire team being involved in spending time discussing it, and that definitely cannot be handled with common sense? Is having this policy worth adding more things new developers must obey, and get asked to change in their future merge requests? Policy issues should be VERY rare, such that we can discuss a small number of them in general meetings. Do not open multiple policy issues in a short timeframe as a way to gather feedback for your own work needs, because they often become some of our most time-consuming issues, and we are all busy.)

**Why**

(What would happen if we don't have, or don't change, this policy?)

**Where**

(Where should the policy be described? There should never be more than one place for this, so we keep it up-to-date.)

**Who**

(Who can take responsibility for documenting this policy in a way that is clearly understandable to new developers?)
